2020-02-01T10:51:11Z,Bump Version back to 14.2-SNAPSHOT after RC
2020-02-01T07:45:15Z,Manually resetting version to mahout 14.1-SNAPSHOT from
mahout 14.2-SNAPSHOT between release:prepare and release:perform
[this is a mistake the version should be 14.1 rather than
14.1 SNAPSHOT] something is still off in the release plugin in the
root pom.xml.  Still pushing out RC4 as is in order to ensure build is
correctly deploying to nexus e.g. sigs and hashes, (hashes seem to be
missing still though they should be applied during deploy per maven docs
checking the distributions, etc.

    Initial merge with ora private-review branch. Stuff compiles up to h2o (which needs to be added some unimplemented stuff) and ssvd tests
    are failing in math-scala module due to lack of matrix flavor on mmul. They are not failing in private branch though -- some changes still
    have not been merged?

    Most changes i care about seems to be there though.

    MAHOUT-1529: Move dense/sparse matrix test in mapBlock into spark/

    In h2o engine, the Matrix provided to mapBlock() is an instance of
    "H2OBlockMatrix extends AbstractMatrix", and neither a DenseMatrix
    nor SparseMatrix. H2OBlockMatrix is a 0-copy virtual Matrix exposing
    just the partition's data (created at almost no expense), and creates
    a copy-on-write Matrix only if modified by the blockmapfunction.

    So these two tests are failing with h2obindings. Hence moving these two
    tests into spark module.

    MAHOUT-1529: spark-shell - cleanup sdc

    Renaming @sc to @sdc has left open the shutdown part. Spark
    depends on 'implicit sc' to be set by the shell invoker.

      mahout> Stopping spark context.
      <console>:29: error: not found: value sc
                    sc.stop()
                    ^

    So override sparkCleanUp() and call @sdc.stop()

2013-05-21T10:52:25Z,MAHOUT-1223: Fixed point being skipped in StreamingKMeans when iterating through centroids from a reducer

When calling StreamingKMeans in the reducer (to collapse the number of clusters
to they can fit into memory), the clustering is done on the Hadoop reducer
iterable.
Currently, the first Centroid is added directly as a special case and then is
skipped when iterating through the main loop.
However, Hadoop reducer iterables cannot be rewound therefore causing SKM to
skip one point.

- removed ClusteringPolicy from ClusterIterator constructor as ClusterClassifier already has one
- added convergence computations for kmeans and fuzzyk
- added final clustersOut renaming to add -final suffix
- updated Display examples and unit tests to reflect above
- all tests run

I think it is time to begin refactoring the buildClusters methods of the respective clustering drivers to use ClusterIterator as it seems to be producing equivalent results to the original implementations. This will involve removing a lot of existing driver, mapper and reducer code and many time-consuming unit tests. It will also have some impact on other components as the representation of clusters in the file system changes from Cluster to self-describing ClusterWritable.

2012-02-12T20:54:26Z,MAHOUT-933: 
- Implemented ClusteringPolicyWritable and made ClusteringPolicies implement Writable so they can be written to the file system. 
- Modified ClusterIterator and CIMapper to write and read the appropriate clustering policy. 

Next steps need to address the fact that clusters do not serialize their observation state (s0, s1, s2) and so the MR version of ClusterIterator does not actually produce correct values. This will be a much bigger project.

2011-05-09T01:49:20Z,MAHOUT-479: added a new iterate method to ClusterIterator. Method accepts 3
hadoop Paths for input, prior and output information plus number of desired iterations. All algorithm data is pulled-from/pushed-to SequenceFiles. Added a unit test and improved the example DisplayKMeans, DisplayFuzzyKMeans and DisplayDirichlet to use the new file-based implementation. Check out Dirichlet.

2011-05-06T04:19:53Z,Fixes MAHOUT-319, by the following means:

  LanczosSolver now takes a LanczosState object as part of its solve() method, and operates on this
state as it iterates.  One of the possible side-effects of completing an iteration is that it persists
state to disk (or HDFS, etc).  When the solver is started up, and passed the path to the intermediate
state and there is already state persisted there, it picks up where it left off.

  This additionally improves scalability for the solver, by not requring more than 3 singular vectors
to be held in memory at any one time, instead of 2*desiredRank dense vectors of this size.

  This API change to LanczosSolver is non-backwards compatible, but hopefully moving to a single 
packaged state object will make it less likely that this kind of change will be needed much in the
future on this class.

2011-04-18T04:19:01Z,MAHOUT-479:  Implemented ClusterClassifier, ClusterPolicy(s) and ClusterIterator which can duplicate k-means and Dirichlet clustering in sequential execution only. Added unit tests and switched DisplayKMeans and DisplayDirichlet to use the ClusterIterator. Gives a pretty good sanity check of the clustering.
Changed pdf() implementation of GaussianCluster to use the product of the component pdfs vs the average. Seems to work a lot better.
Deprecated a number of old Dirichlet models and the experimental VectorModelClassifier.
Changed the type of AbstractCluster numPoints to long from int

2010-09-29T21:52:20Z,Adjusted class structure and API for classifiers to allow a group key to passed down into the training.
Also broke out the gradient computation to allow variant training objectives such as AUC in addition to logistic loss.
Added the gradient to serialized content
Made a new PolymorphicTypeAdapter to limit amount of repeated code

2010-09-29T20:27:46Z,MAHOUT-513:
- replaced RunningSumsGaussianAccumulator with OnlineGaussianAccumulator in CDbwEvaluator
- updated unit tests to new metric values
- added a test to ignore empty lines in synthetic control input mappers

- removed weighting from GaussianAccumulator.observe(). It's not needed for
CDbw and is problematic in the OnlineGaussianAccumulator.  Tests all run.

2010-09-29T16:27:04Z,MAHOUT-513
- Created interface GaussianAccumulator and two concrete implementations:
  - RunningSumsGaussianAccumulator uses running sums approach
  - OnlineGaussianAccumulator uses Knuth (Welford) approach
- Added unit test thereof which produces significant std deviations and drastically-odd
  variances. I'm committing this so it can get more eyeballs. It is not used anywhere yet.
- Refactored CDbwClusterEvaluator to use RunningSumsGaussianAccumulator and
  existing tests continue to run
- Cleaned up logging in various clustering algorithms to increase use of debug vs. info
  to reduce log clutter
All tests run.

2010-09-14T17:35:51Z,MAHOUT-294: Added arguments to the DistributedLanczosSolver CLI so that
it can optionally launch the EigenVerificationJob. Added a new run() method with
additional arguments needed by EVJ. Added new unit tests of the CLI and adjusted
some of the cluster dumper tests to use the new run method. All tests run.

NOTE: this patch changes the semantics of the DLS --output argument: Formerly
it was the path to the output (raw) eigenvectors file. Now it is a path to an output
directory in which a rawEigenvectors file will be written. If the EVJ is also specified,
then the output directory will contain a cleanEigenvectors file in addition.

2010-08-19T17:32:49Z,MAHOUT-479: This commit refactors Cluster to inherit from Model<VectorWritable> instead of AbstractCluster
which now inherits just Cluster. The existing Dirichlet models also now inherit from Cluster, simplifying the use
of generics and cleaning up a lot of the code.

Since Dirichlet now can iterate over arbitrary Clusters as its models, this opens up the entire set of DistanceMeasure
based clusters for Dirichlet processing. This should allow the output of e.g. Canopy to become the prior model
distribution in a subsequent Dirichlet step. Is this a feature?

The AbstractCluster hierarchy has been adjusted allowing GaussianClusterDistribution and 
DistanceMeasureClusterDistribution to instantiate its subclasses. Both have tests and seem to work as expected.

All unit tests run. More to follow

2010-07-24T03:39:30Z,MAHOUT-294:
- modified most DisplayClustering subclasses to use the new sequential method on drivers. (Not Dirichlet yet)
- using file system to transmit Clusters required a rework since they were not serializing needed state
- refactored Canopy, Cluster, SoftCluster and MeanShiftCanopy significantly, abstracting shared behavior to new AbstractCluster class.
- deleted ClusterBase after moving static method to AbstractCluster
- added ClusterObservations to replace KMeansInfo and FuzzyKMeansInfo
- changed all cluster identifier formatting to include type indication
- upshot of new clusters is improved posterior statistics for all with radius() now returning stdDev(), a vector
- new radius() used in Display examples to show elliptical clusters
- adjusted unit tests and all pass

probably should have made a new JIRA for some of this

For MersenneTwister, I went back to the C reference implementation and generated unit tests based on that.  Then I walked the code generating unit tests based on equivalent performance.

2010-04-22T20:47:39Z,MAHOUT-236: Improvements to consistency of all clustering algorithms:
- Cleaned up cluster asFormatString(x) so all clusters have similar naming
- Added ClusterDumper tests for fuzzyK and MeanShift
- Cleaned up cluster job intermediate file nomenclature:
- All initial clusters go into clusters-0 directory
- All cluster outputs go into clusters-i directory, where i is iteration number (1..n)
- All clustered points go into clusteredPoints directory
- Moved intermediate file nomenclature to standard constants in ClusterBase

all tests run but I think FuzzyKMeans is broken or my pilot error since it produces anomalous outputs with ClusterDumper and CDbw tests. I will debug that next.

shared code.  There may be more changes.

2010-02-09T21:30:17Z,MAHOUT-270:

This patch adds the Printable interface and unifies ClusterBase, Model and DirichletCluster as implementors. I did not extend this to Vector or Matrix, though that is possible, preferring to write a simple vector formatter in ClusterBase which is used by all implementations.

Added back the JsonModelAdapter and JsonClusterAdapter which I removed recently because they were unused. Adding back Json formatting to the Dirichlet clustering required their reinstatement.

Added TestPrintableInterface which tests the new implementations. All other tests continue to run.

TODO: need to modify ClusterDumper to complete this issue but, as it has users who may want some time to review the new code, I will hold off for a few days.

2010-01-28T06:11:42Z,Sorry about the montser commit, but I was on a roll.

Fixes MAHOUT-269, MAHOUT-268, MAHOUT-267, MAHOUT-263, MAHOUT-209, MAHOUT-265, and MAHOUT-208.  MAHOUT-211 was actually not fixed yet either, but now is.

Also includes 

  * some UnaryFunction / DoubleFunction and BinaryFunction / DoubleDoubleFunction refactor-merging,
  * performance tuning in the world of vectors: AbstracVector.assign(BinaryFunction f, double d) can be sparse-optimized in the case where f(0,d) = 0, much like assign(UnaryFunction f), when f(0) == 0.
  * SquaredEuclideanDistanceMeasure (and hence EuclideanDistanceMeasure) were both broken and wrong (see discussion on mahout-dev).  Fixed now.  Tests passed before, and still do though.  There'll be another checkin on that subject shortly.
  * tests for much of the above.

mvn clean install works fine, but I haven't run all the drivers.

2010-01-21T14:20:01Z,Initial import for MAHOUT-180.  Brings in all the core of decomposer.  Lots more to do (to be described on the list [and wiki - need wiki!]), but has a couple unit tests to verify correctness, and my recent checkins in the rest of mahout-math help optimize for performance.

- Removed SparseNormalModelDistribution
- Removed TestSparseModelClustering

- Added L1Model
- Added L1ModelDistribution
- Added TestL1ModelClustering which builds Lucene index and Mahout utils TFIDF

- Fixed defect in NormalModel.toString since iterateNonZero does not iterate in sequential order

Unit test seems to find 5 models for the 8 documents, 4 of which are very similar, and models have the correct non-zero terms

Created a new SparseNormalModelDistribution to begin attacking the text clustering domain. First implementation is based upon NormalModel and NormalModelDistribution but adds a filtering step to sampleFromPosterior to set insignificant mean elements to 0.0 to conserve space.

Adjusted NormalModel.toString to be more SparseVector-friendly and introduced TestSparseModelClustering tests

- DirichletDriver, DirichletJob - added command line arguments for modelPrototypeClass and prototypeSize
- Display2dASNDirichlet, DisplayASNDirichlet, DisplayASNOutputState, DisplayDirichlet, DisplayNDirichlet,
	DisplayOutputState, DisplaySNDirichlet - added modelProtype initializations to model distributions
	
- math/SquareRootFunction - changed computation from abs() to sqrt() as the previous had crept in during recent
	refactoring and was completely horking the Dirichlet std() calculations
	
- Cluster - changed std calculation to remove size=2 assumption
- NormalModel - changed computeParameters to use std.size() vs s1.size() for uniformity
- AsymmetricSampledNormalModel - changed comment in computeParameters

2010-01-18T03:17:10Z,MAHOUT-251: Generalized and refactored Dirichlet models and model distributions to 
remove 2-d and dense vector assumptions by introducing a new abstract 
VectorModelDistribution to provide a modelProtootype and size to the distributions for 
creating prior models of arbitrary vector size and flavor.

Removed unused classes and all Json serialization code. Updated unit tests and added 
new tests of 3-d models.

Fixed an initialization bug in the synthetic control InputDriver and updated clustering examples
which now run.

Classes removed:
- DirichletCombiner
- ModelHolder
- JsonDirichletStateAdapter
- JsonModelAdapter
- JsonModelDistributionAdapter
- JsonModelHolderAdapter

New Classes:
- VectorModelDistribution - abstract superclass holds modelPrototype for subclasses

ModifiedClasses:
- DirichletCluster - removed asFormatString and fromFormatString Json serialization which were unused
- DirichletDriver - added modelPrototypeClass and prototypeSIze arguments for initializing VectorModelDistributions
- DirichletMapper - incorporated above arguments in state initialization
- NormalModelDistribution, SampledNormalModelDistribution, AsymmetricSampledNormalDistribution - 
	removed 2-d DenseVector dependencies by using superclass modelPrototype
- AsymmetricSampledNormalModel - removed 2-d restrictions

2009-09-08T12:41:28Z,Improve calculation in the 'get all other items' methods. If an item is not preferred by anybody who has at least one item coocurring with the current user, then it can't possibly be recommended by any existing algorithm. By building up the set of possibilities more intelligently, a lot of work can be saved. Speed up was 50-400% in a couple tests using an item-based recommender. Made similar changes and refinements to related code across the board. (Thanks Gokhan)

2009-04-16T21:32:11Z,MAHOUT-118 fixes all of the occurrences (except one) of FileSystem.get to use the two argument version with an appropriate Path as a first argument.

The only remaining instance is in org.apache.mahout.ga.watchmaker.MahoutEvaluator at line 64, where there's no obvious Path available to provide the first argument. Getting this one working will probably require refactoring.

The purpose of this patch is not to replace the Ant build, it is to /support/ Maven users that wants to produce project files for their development environment. Perhaps it also could be used for us to produce official Maven artifacts.

2008-04-21T17:29:14Z,Added asFormatString() to Vector and Matrix interfaces and factored methods out of asWritableComparable() implementations. This is in preparation for removing the Point class (MAHOUT-47) which is redundant and only used for similar formatting by canopy and kmeans clustering. In general, other classes needing to produce formatted representations of themselves will benefit from asFormatString, which returns a more useful result than a pre-wrapped WritableComparable.

Classes Modified: AbstractMatrix, AbstractVector, DenseMatrix, DenseVector, Matrix, MatrixView, SparseColumnMatrix, SparseMatrix, SparseRowMatrix, SparseVector, Vector and VectorView.

All unit tests run. Did not add new tests since code is factored from and tested by existing tests.

2008-04-15T01:16:52Z,Initial commit of MAHOUT-15 introduces a variant of the Canopy cluster that uses an iterative approach to shift and merge canopies that are created for each original input point. As canopies shift and merge, they converge upon the modes of the input point density function and define the resulting clusters.  

- MeanShiftCanopy.java: Defined by a center and a list of bound points. During each iteration, the canopies within their T1 radius are used to determine a weighted centroid which becomes the next canopy center. Canopies moving within their T2 radius are merged and the bound points are accumulated.
- MeanShiftCanopyMapper.java: The mapper reads input canopies and outputs information to the combiner that is used to shift and merge its canopies.
- MeanShiftCanopyCombiner.java: The combiner accumulates information about the mapper's canopies and outputs them in their new centroid positions.
- MeanShiftCanopyReducer.java: The reducer merges the outputs of multiple mapper/combiners and performs another shift merge iteration.
- MeanShiftCanopyDriver.java: Is the driver for an iteration of the algorithm
- MeanShiftCanopyJob.java: Controls the iterations until all canopies have converged
- DenseVector.java
   - toString(): produces a string representation of the receiver
   - asWritableComparable: uses toString()
- DistanceMeasure.java
   - distance: Float[] argument method is deprecated
   - distance: new method with Vector arguments
- EuclideanDistanceMeasure: Implements new distance method
- ManhattanDistanceMeasure: Implements new distance method
- DummyOutputCollector.java: Used for unit tests
- TestMeanShift.java: Unit tests of the algorithm
